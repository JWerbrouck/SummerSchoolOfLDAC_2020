    "# Publish Smart Home Sensor Data using SWT\n",
    "Lecturer: **Georg Ferdinand Schneider**, [RG](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Georg_Schneider3)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart home systems are increasingly used in residential flats and buildings. Mostly these systems increase the comfort of a home either by improving indoor air quality, thermal comfort or integrate multimedia applications in the system. A tremendous amount of data is produced by these systems and it is difficult to integrate data from different systems, as typically vendors and communication protocols differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked Building Data (LBD) may provide a remedy to the interoperability problems stemming from this multi-vendor, multi-protocol and multi-domain setting. In this coding challenge you will research what possibilities exist to integrate sensor data obtained from smart home systems with other data using Semantic Web Technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* RQ1: What possibilities exist to publish observations of sensors using SWT?\n",
    "* RQ2: How can the sensor data be linked to additional data sources available on the web (e.g. weather services)?\n",
    "* RQ3: What best practices and recommendations exist for the storage of large amounts time series data in SWT?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The Open Smart Home data set [1] is a data set obtained from a real smart home. It is composed of static data describing a real residential flat situated in Nürnberg, Germany and dynamic data, i.e. time series, obtained from real sensors and actuators placed in the residential flat.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of ontologies exist in the smart home domain, which may serve as a starting point [3,4]. Also a strong set of recommended standards to publish sensor and acutator data on the web exists [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the influx DB [https://www.influxdata.com/](https://www.influxdata.com/), which is a database specifically design to store time series data or the RDF to relational data bases (R2RDB) mapping [6] as implemented in the Ontop tool [https://github.com/ontop/ontop](https://github.com/ontop/ontop).\n",
