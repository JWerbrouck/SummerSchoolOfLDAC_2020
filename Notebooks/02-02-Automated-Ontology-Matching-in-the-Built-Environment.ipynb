    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Ontology-based modelling in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction/ Facility Management (AEC/FM) has gained significant attention both by industry and academia in the past years. The result is a proliferating development of ontologies, which significantly overlap [1,2] and, thus, recreate separated silos of associated knowledge. As Euzenat & Shvaiko [3] state: 'Thus, merely using ontologies, like using XML, does not reduce heterogeneity: it raises heterogeneity problems to a higher level'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the reappearance of interoperability issues, there is a strong need to develop core ontologies to describe concepts and relationships reoccuring in every domain, e.g. the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) [1,4] and define alignments to it. The manual definition of alignments among domain ontologies is possible [2], however, almost as difficult as creating ontologies from scratch. Hence, there is an urgent need to [5]:\n",

    "* Deploy existing ontology matching methods and tools in the AEC/FM domain  \n",
    "* Create benchmarks from AEC/FM domain for ontology matching experts  \n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks in this coding challenge involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deploy, fine tune and explore existing ontology matching methods and tools\n",
    "* Revise and extend a set of existing ontologies towards developing a benchmark for the [Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI)](http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* RQ1: Which levels of alignment occur when matching domain ontologies of the AEC/FM to BOT?\n",
    "* RQ2: Which dedicated matching methods exist for the matching problems occuring in the AEC/FM domain?\n",
    "* RQ3: Which domains and potential candidate ontologies need to be included to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for the OAEI?\n",

    "An initial effort on automated ontology matching is made in Schneider [5]. A set of six domain ontologies is matched to BOT and the automated and manual alignments are found here:.\n",
