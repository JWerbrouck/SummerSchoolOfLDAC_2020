    "\n",
    "The first session of the [LDAC summer school](http://linkedbuildingdata.net/ldac2019/summerschool/) is about the vision and basics of the Semantic Web and Linked Data. You will be introduced to Linked Data in general, and with the work of the [Linked Building Data (LBD) community group](https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/) in particular. Through a number of slides (see [Presentation](../presentations/20190616_LinkedData.pdf)), you will be introduced to the technical basics. More specifically, this session introduces the concept of linked data, graphs, ontologies, and graph-based information modelling in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through the exercises listed in this document, you'll learn to think in terms of graphs about the built environment that surrounds you. More particularly, you will apply this to the room in which you are currently in. Furthermore, you’ll learn how to represent this room in an RDF graph, and you’ll be introduced to the concept of ontologies and vocabularies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "-\tUnderstand the principles of Linked (Building) Data (LBD)\n",
    "-\tUnderstand the basics on what information can be described in ontologies\n",
    "-\tConstruct an LBD-compliant RDF graph\n",
    "\n",
    "## ASSIGNMENT 1 – WHERE IN THE GRAPH ARE WE???\n",
    "##### PRESENTATION P. PAUWELS\n",
    "Our environment can be described in many ways. Let's describe our environment in a graph!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1.1\n",
    "Take pen and paper and post-its. Define with nodes and arcs what building and space we are in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember:\n",
    "-\tNodes are in ellipses; literals are in rectangles\n",
    "-\tEvery arc needs a label\n",
    "-\tEvery element in the room needs to have a URI\n",
    "\n",
    "![Linked Data on Paper](../figures/graphOnPaper.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1.2 \n",
    "Evaluate: \n",
    "-\tWhat terms did you use? \n",
    "-\tWhat is vocabulary, what is data?\n",
    "-\tWhat could be re-used or defined by others?\n",
    "-\tDoes every 'thing' have its own identifier or node?\n",
    "-\tWhere are literals and where are nodes?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1.3\n",
    "Evaluate: what kind of data was difficult to represent in a graph? What kind of data was easy to represent in a graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tDid you include geometry?\n",
    "-\tDid you include time schedule data?\n",
    "-\tWhy (not)?\n",
    "\n",
    "## ASSIGNMENT 2 – THE VOCABULARY OR ONTOLOGY\n",
    "##### PRESENTATION M. POVEDA-VILLALON\n",
    "An initial ontology or vocabulary file is available in the LDAC folder ([ldac.ttl](../data/introToLinkedData-Exercises/ldac.ttl)). This vocabulary defines a building class, a space class, and a relation between both. This ontology or vocabulary can be used to start defining the environment and elements around you (the 'data' or 'instances'). The vocabulary only defines the overall terminology and definitions that can be used to define concepts and things; it does not define actual things.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2.1\n",
    "- Open the vocabulary ([ldac.ttl](../data/introToLinkedData-Exercises/ldac.ttl)) in an online visualization tool (e.g. [WebVOWL](http://www.visualdataweb.de/webvowl/)) and explore what is already defined.\n",
    "- Copy the content of the file into the \"Triples\" tab of the [SPARQL-visualizer](https://madsholten.github.io/sparql-visualizer/) and explore the full content of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tInstructions:\n",
    "\t* Click on the dropdown list and click \"1. Sample data\"  \n",
    "\t* Open the tabs that appear on the right (Triples, Query, Result). \n",
    "\t* Change some of the data in the Triples tab, Update, and perform the query again. Notice the differences in the resulting graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "\t![Linked Data in SPARQL-visualizer](../figures/SPARQL-visualizer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also open the file in Notepad and explore what you see. \n",
    "\n",
    "\tEvaluate\n",
    "\t* What is a namespace?\n",
    "\t* What is a prefix?\n",
    "\t* Is everything unique? Why (not)?\n",
    "\t* What is the difference between ‘.’, ‘;’, and ‘,’?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "The RDF file is encoded in a syntax called Turtle. Turtle is one of the more human-readable serialization languages for RDF graphs. The two listings below contain the same information and demonstrate how the Turtle syntax provides means to make a more compact and readable file.\n",

    "\tNote: In turtle, \"a\" is a shortcut for rdf:type. This is handy since this predicate is used so often.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tNote: graphs in the RDF data model can be described in a number of serialisation formats, namely Turtle, TTL, RDF, etc. Converting between these file formats can be done at: http://www.easyrdf.org/converter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2.2 \n",
    "Add classes and properties to the ontology/vocabulary, using the [Web VOWL editor](http://visualdataweb.de/webvowl_editor/) and/or Notepad (as preferred). Make sure that you have all the vocabulary you need to describe the classroom and/or building of this course.\n",
    "\n",

    "##### PRESENTATION M.H. RASMUSSEN\n",
    "Whenever one defines the actual room, building, chair, or anything (namely, the things that have actual physical presence in our surrounding environment), this definition follows a certain vocabulary or ontology (see assignment 1). Such ontologies and vocabularies can be defined using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and RDF Schema (RDFS). Assignment 2 focused on defining such ontologies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data defined in correspondence with an ontology are called 'instance data' or 'individuals'. They are represented as an RDF graph (see graph in assignment 1). Together, the ontology and the data constitute a 'knowledge graph'. In this assignment, we will make such data for the current building or room.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3.1\n",
    "Open the sample data file ([todaysroom.ttl](../data/introToLinkedData-Exercises/todaysroom.ttl)) in NotePad and explore what is already defined. Describe with your own words what the file contains. Relate it to the ontology and the previous discussions on vocabulary vs. data.\n",

    "Copy the content of the sample data file [todaysroom.ttl](../data/introToLinkedData-Exercises/todaysroom.ttl) in the \"Triples\" tab of the SPARQL-visualiser and visualize the defined data.

Try to define the room as good as possible, and try to query and visualize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "When using terminology of an ontology in a SPARQL query, the namespace of that ontology must be defined as demonstrated below. Here the prefix \"ldac\" is defined with the namespace of our ontology. Defining such prefixes in SPARQL is slightly different from defining them in TTL (e.g. PREFIX vs. @prefix).\n",

    "    ?space ?property ?value .\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The SPARQL-visualizer app uses CONSTRUCT queries by default to construct the graphs that need to be displayed in the visualizer. As another example, the below query can be used to construct a graph that contains everything that is currently in the graph.\n",
