    "[RG](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pieter_Pauwels)  \n",

    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This coding challenge has been submitted to the Summer School of LDAC committee by Reinder Peterse and builds on his BIMhub.org idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry uses a lot of different models, software, ontologies etc. Standardization is still a long way and we notice that large software vendors are not keen to support open datamodels but rather develop and promote closed platform solutions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem for contractors and consultants. A common work around is that these parties use an own model by creating new datamodels with custom attributes etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "From practical experience by using different ontologies, programming libraries, etc., it becomes clear that on a **data level** common concepts and attributes as well as modelling patterns reoccur [1]. For instance, in one model we call an 'object' an 'object', someone else would use the term 'asset'. Discussions on aligning are more about 'how should we call a chair' or 'is a chair a child of a room or a child of a lounge set' etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "From practical expertise it has been noticed that there is a strong need for a deeper level of standardizations: standardizations on the datamodel\n",
    "level:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An Database Object 'Asset' has attributes, e.g.:\n",
    "  * UUID, type, creation date, Name, Description, etc.\n",
    "* An Database Object 'Asset' has (1:n/n:n;n:1) relations with:\n",
    "  * Other assets\n",
    "  * Geo location\n",
    "  * Vector info\n",
    "  * Classification\n",
    "  * Etc\n",
    "\n",
    "A unification on this structural and topological design decisions of the underlying data model can provide benefits to easen communication among partners and tools as well as integrations between data models are cheaper and easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the coding challenge you will work on the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Examine existing data format and ontologies related to BIM-based information exchange  \n",
    "*  Develop a concept and workflow of a web application for an open, consensual development of a common data model  \n",
    "* Develop a concept and prototypically implement a BIM integration hub platform, which allows to link various data formats and serves as a hub for applications  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* RQ1: What is the difference between IFC, AEC domain ontologies, Object Type Libraries and a proposed Common Data Model to save and share the actual Asset data. What is the difference between them and where do they overlay?\n",
    "* RQ2: Which basic structural and topological design patterns do reoccur in BIM-related datamodel and database structures?\n",
    "* RQ3: What competency questions can be formulated in terms of reoccuring structural and topological design patterns in BIM-related datamodels and database structure?\n",
    "* RQ4: What are the minimal requirements for a Common Data Model in BIM-related information exchange?\n",
    "* RQ5: How can Semantic Web Technologies address the described problems and challenges?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",

    "* Several building models are available on the web, e.g. [Duplex Apartment House as \n",
    "IFC](https://portal.nibs.org/files/wl/?id=4DsTgHFQAcOXzFetxbpRCECPbbfUqpgo), [OSH Flat as \n",
    "IFC](https://github.com/TechnicalBuildingSystems/OpenSmartHomeData/blob/master/04_Flat.ifc), [Open IFC model server](http://openifcmodel.cs.auckland.ac.nz/Model)\n",
    "* [BOT ontology](https://w3id.org/bot)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",

    "* [IFCtoRDF](https://github.com/pipauwel/IFCtoRDF) converter  \n",
    "* [Jena library](https://jena.apache.org/)  \n",
    "* [RDFlib - a python module for rdf parsing and serialisation](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/)  \n",
