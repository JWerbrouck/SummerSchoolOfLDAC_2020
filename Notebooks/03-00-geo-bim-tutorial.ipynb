				"* Show how to install the Jena code base for adding GeoSPARQL to a sample ifcOWL and BOT model.\n",

				"## STEP 3 SETTING UP THE TRIPLESTORE AND GEOSPARQL \n",
				"\n",
				"Setting up a triplestore and SPARQL endpoint is straightforward. Several suites exist which support GeoSPARQL:\n",
				"\n",
				"* [Stardog](http://stardog.com/) (free for non-commercial purposes)  \n",
				"* [Parliament](http://parliament.semwebcentral.org/)  \n",
				"* [Apache Jena and Fuseki](https://github.com/galbiston/geosparql-fuseki)  \n",
				"* …  \n",
				"\n",
				"For this tutorial, we are going to use Stardog. GeoSPARQL is only supported with the commercial license, so if your license has run out, Parliament is a good free option (and very easy to setup!). \n",
				"\n",
				"After you download stardog, extract it into a folder on your hard drive, following the instructions [here](https://www.stardog.com/docs/#_quick_start_guide)\n",
				"\n",
				"For windows the following instructions are given:\n",
				"\n",
				"First, tell Stardog where its home directory (where databases and other files will be stored) is:\n",
				"\n",
				"> SET STARDOG_HOME=C:\\data\\stardog\n",
				"\n",
				"Second, copy the stardog-license-key.bin into the right place:\n",
				"\n",
				"> COPY /B stardog-license-key.bin %STARDOG_HOME%\n",
				"\n",
				"Stardog won’t run without a valid Stardog-license-key.bin in STARDOG_HOME. You should have received one when you downloaded Stardog.\n",
				"\n",
				"Third, optionally, place the bin folder of the Stardog install on your PATH so the stardog.bat and stardog-admin.bat scripts can be used regardless of current working directory\n",
				"\n",
				"> SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\\stardog-6.2.1\\bin\n",
				"\n",
				"You must also make sure you have a JDK installed. For Stardog 6.2.1 I used the latest JDK downloaded from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)\n",
				"\n",
				"Before you start your server there are still a few more hoops to jump through. First you will need to create a stardog.properties file and save it into folder data/stardog. You can find the properties file [here](https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog-examples/blob/develop/config/stardog.properties)\n",
				"\n",
				"You need to them comment out the line “spatial.use.jts=true” (remove the #).\n",
				"\n",
				"Next you will need to download [JTS](http://central.maven.org/maven2/com/vividsolutions/jts-core/1.14.0/jts-core-1.14.0.jar) and save it into your stardog-6.2.1\\server\\ext \n",
				"(create the ext folder if it is not already there).\n",
				"\n",
				"Now you can start Stardog!\n",
				"\n",
				"For this tutorial we will use the web console provided by Stardog to check if our database has been successfully created (using the –web-console command). You also need to disable security so that it works with yasgui (see next section). Run the following command in your command line (if you have not set the path for Stardog, you can run this command from the bin folder in your Stardog download): \n",
				"\n",
				"> C:\\stardog-admin.bat server start --web-console --disable-security\n",
